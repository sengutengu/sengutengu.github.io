        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <h2>Biology</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in biology began in early childhood as aesthetic enjoyment
          of, and curiosity about, the diversity of forms that life can take. I
          took on a particular interest in invertebrates precisely because they
          were so different from us vertebrates, and I devoured picture books,
          field guides, and encyclopedias to learn about insects and molluscs,
          especially the most charismatic ones like the horned
          <i>kabutomushi</i> and cone snails with their venomous stingers.
          Later, as I read Jean-Henri Fabre and Korean malacologist Kwon Ogil’s
          essays on snails (deftly interwoven with philosophical musings on the
          human condition), I began to appreciate the idea that a diversity of
          forms engenders a corresponding diversity of functions and strategies
          for survival and reproduction, ones that might be novel and bizarre
          from the mammalian perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was upon my move to the United States when I was nine that I began
          collecting insect and mollusc specimens in earnest. Though I was
          linguistically isolated from my new peers, my scientific world became
          richer because nature was far more ample in the suburbs of
          Philadelphia than in urban Korea, and once I became fluent in English,
          I could access scientific information about invertebrates which was
          far more abundant in English than in Korean. I caught and pinned
          insects during the summers and bought bags of seashells from craft
          stores to identify and place into taxonomies. With a desire to make
          the information I read in English available in Korean, I ran a
          Korean-language blog on which I uploaded photos of my collection with
          taxonomic descriptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The six years I spent in the United States as a boy were fraught with
          material hardship and family conflict, which ultimately led to my
          decision not to pursue biology in college. However, my fondness for
          biology never left me: as a student at Boston College, I kept fish,
          snails, and millipedes to nourish my soul, and attended talks at the
          Cambridge Entomological Society. At the end of my MA in linguistics,
          as I concluded that I was not, in fact, interested in a career in
          computational linguistics, I began to think very seriously about the
          kind of life I wanted to live. I realized that, if I wanted my work to
          be personally meaningful and enjoyable, biology had to have a part in
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I have taken enough courses at Boston College to exceed a
          minor in biology (enjoying the tuition remission very much as an
          employee!), which I have found deeply rewarding. I am, as before,
          interested in invertebrate systematics first and foremost, but I
          appreciate all aspects of invertebrates (ecology, physiology...) and
          am eager to learn about those areas. In addition, through school and
          work, I have found teaching to be particularly fulfilling, and I would
          like to eventually end up in a position to work in scientific
          education and communication. I hope to start graduate school in 2025
          in biology or entomology to develop these interests further.

        <h2>Linguistics and Korean Studies</h2>
        <p>
          I moved from South Korea to the United States when I was nine, and
          found between me and my new peers a deep linguistic divide. Because I
          could neither understand nor speak English, I remained silent for the
          first two years of school here, and my peers were stunned to hear me
          fly off in fluent English my third year. Even then, from translating
          for my parents and listening to my peers fail to pronounce my name and
          my lunches, I realized that certain sounds, particles, and phrase
          structures in Korean were unavailable to my English-speaking peers,
          just as the English distinction between /ɹ/ and /l/ or "the" and "a"
          had been lost to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Koreans invest staggering amounts of time, effort, and money into
          developing English ability because they see it as crucial to obtaining
          and maintaining socioeconomic status. My parents uprooted their
          middle-class life in Korea so that my sister and I could learn to
          speak English “like a native”, in a practice called “early study
          abroad” (<em>chogi yuhak</em>). As a child, I primarily got a crushing
          sense of responsibility out of our ill-fated stay in the United
          States, but when we returned to Korea, I realized that I bypassed six
          years of a grueling school system which feeds six billion dollars per
          year to the English education industry alone. As a sixteen-year-old
          high school dropout, I was paid handsomely as a “native-like” English
          tutor to an elementary schooler, a young businesswoman, and a business
          executive before they each realized that I was, in fact, utterly
          clueless about language pedagogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences were formative in my choice to study linguistics in
          college. I developed a desire to explore the breadth of structures
          among languages (nurtured in great part by exposure to a variety of
          languages on
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/sengutengu">Duolingo</a>!),
          and to understand how English came to possess so many to take extreme
          measures in its pursuit. I also hoped, as a secondary goal, that I
          would learn to overcome my insecurities which stemmed from my period
          of linguistic isolation. My time studying linguistics at Boston
          College taught me so much more—I learned to appreciate the surprising
          unity underlying the diversity of structures across languages, and to
          evaluate theories and propose new ones to maximally account for
          available language data. I also learned to situate linguistics, as a
          discipline tied to some of the most progressive
          <em>and</em> regressive social movements, within history.

        <p>
          Currently, I am interested in Korea’s contact with modernity. In
          particular, I see Korea’s current hypercompetitive society and its
          ailments (youth unemployment, economic inequality, declining birth
          rates) as a direct consequence of Koreans’ Darwinian understanding of
          modernity as an object of mastery necessary for their survival in a
          globalizing world. To understand the sources and development of this
          worldview, I have been examining the influential editorials on
          <em>Tongnipsinmun</em>, the first Korean-language newspaper, by Soh
          Jaipil, who fled to America and became the first Korean with an
          American medical degree after throwing a failed coup. I am also
          interested in Koreans’ responses to loanwords, and have been analyzing
          a database of “purified” loanwords maintained by the National
          Institute of Korean Language.
