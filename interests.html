        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <h2>Biology and Chemistry</h2>
        <p>
          My interest in biology began in early childhood as aesthetic enjoyment
          of, and curiosity about, the diversity of forms that life can take. I
          took on a particular interest in invertebrates precisely because they
          were so different from us vertebrates, and I devoured picture books,
          encyclopedias, and field guides to learn about charismatic insects and
          molluscs, like the horned <i>kabutomushi</i> and cone snails with
          their venomous stingers. Later, as I read Jean-Henri Fabre and Korean
          malacologist Kwon Ogil’s essays on snails (interwoven with
          philosophical musings on the human condition…), I began to appreciate
          the idea that a diversity of forms engenders a corresponding diversity
          of functions and strategies for survival and reproduction, ones that
          might be novel and bizarre from the mammalian perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was upon my move to the United States when I was nine that I began
          collecting insect and mollusc specimens in earnest. Though I was
          linguistically isolated from my peers, my scientific world expanded
          because nature was far more ample in the suburbs of Philadelphia than
          in urban Korea, and once I became fluent in English, I could access
          scientific information about invertebrates in English which was far
          more abundant than in Korean. I caught and pinned insects during the
          summers and bought bags of seashells from craft stores to identify and
          place into taxonomies. With a desire to make the information I read in
          English available in Korean, I ran a Korean-language blog on which I
          uploaded photos of my collection with taxonomic descriptions.
        </p>
        <h2>Linguistics and Korean Studies</h2>
        <p>
          I moved from South Korea to the United States when I was nine, and
          found between me and my new peers a deep linguistic divide. Because I
          could neither understand nor speak English, I remained silent for the
          first two years of school here, and my peers were stunned to hear me
          fly off in fluent English my third year. Even then, from translating
          for my parents and listening to my peers fail to pronounce my name and
          my lunches, I realized that certain sounds, particles, and phrase
          structures in Korean were unavailable to my English-speaking peers,
          just as the English distinction between /ɹ/ and /l/ or "the" and "a"
          had been lost to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Koreans invest staggering amounts of time, effort, and money into
          developing English ability because they see it as crucial to obtaining
          and maintaining socioeconomic status. My parents uprooted their
          middle-class life in Korea so that my sister and I could learn to
          speak English “like a native”, in a practice called “early study
          abroad” (<em>chogi yuhak</em>). As a child, I primarily got a crushing
          sense of responsibility out of our ill-fated stay in the United
          States, but when we returned to Korea, I realized that I bypassed six
          years of a grueling school system which feeds six billion dollars per
          year to the English education industry alone. As a sixteen-year-old
          high school dropout, I was paid handsomely as a “native-like” English
          tutor to an elementary schooler, a young businesswoman, and a business
          executive before they each realized that I was, in fact, utterly
          clueless about language pedagogy.
        </p>
        <p>
          These experiences were formative in my choice to study linguistics in
          college. I developed a desire to explore the breadth of structures
          among languages (nurtured in great part by exposure to a variety of
          languages on
          <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/profile/sengutengu">Duolingo</a>!),
          and to understand how English came to possess so many to take extreme
          measures in its pursuit. I also hoped, as a secondary goal, that I
          would learn to overcome my insecurities which stemmed from my period
          of linguistic isolation. My time studying linguistics at Boston
          College taught me so much more—I learned to appreciate the surprising
          unity underlying the diversity of structures across languages, and to
          evaluate theories and propose new ones to maximally account for
          available language data. I also learned to situate linguistics, as a
          discipline tied to some of the most progressive
          <em>and</em> regressive social movements, within history.

          Currently, I am interested in Korea’s contact with modernity. In
          particular, I see Korea’s current hypercompetitive society and its
          ailments (youth unemployment, economic inequality, declining birth
          rates) as a direct consequence of Koreans’ Darwinian understanding of
          modernity as an object of mastery necessary for their survival in a
          globalizing world. To understand the sources and development of this
          worldview, I have been examining the influential editorials on
          <em>Tongnipsinmun</em>, the first Korean-language newspaper, by Soh
          Jaipil, who fled to America and became the first Korean with an
          American medical degree after throwing a failed coup. I am also
          interested in Koreans’ responses to loanwords, and have been analyzing
          a database of “purified” loanwords maintained by the National
          Institute of Korean Language.
